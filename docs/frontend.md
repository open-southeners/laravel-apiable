# Implementations

To complement this package functionality you'll want to add one of these packages we described here.

## What about the frontend?

So many of you will ask this same question. The answer is simple as JSON:API is a common protocol, you could do your own implementation or use one of these:

- JavaScript browser & server (NodeJS / SSR-capable): [https://github.com/olosegres/jsona](https://github.com/olosegres/jsona)
- Check any other libraries in: [https://jsonapi.org/implementations/](https://jsonapi.org/implementations/)

### Flex URL <Badge type="danger" text="ðŸŒ¶ hot" vertical="middle" />

If you want to parse the URL following the JSON:API standard from your Node or browser app, you should check out this package also maintained by us: https://github.com/open-southeners/flex-url

[And its documentation here](https://docs.opensoutheners.com/flex-url/)
